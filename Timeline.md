# Timeline

We recommend following this timeline if you don't have any development experience:

## The C boot camp

Made of daily exercises that go from very easy at the beginning, to pretty advanced at the end.

The goal of the C boot camp is to introduce you to the development.

It will be split up into days, but you can work on them whenever you want.

It will start with a few exercises to discover your working environment, and then a lot more exercises to discover the C programming language.

An example of a C boot camp day is given [here](Day03.md).

## The first project

You will have to use everything you saw during the C boot camp in order to complete this project. The goal is to go over everything you saw, and apply it to a real project.

## Projects

These can take days, even weeks to complete.

We also highly recommend doing them as a group.
Check out [the discord page](Discord.md) for more information about groups.

We're not sure how many there will be yet, but it's going to be at the very least 10.

You do not have to complete all of them, but we highly recommend doing so as they will all provide new concepts to learn.

## Portfolio project

After working on the projects for a while, you should be ready to start working on your own projects, and learn other programming languages.

This is the point of this _Portfolio project_.
Its goal is to show a recruiter what you can do, and that you can learn on your own.

The best way to do that is to create a project from the ground up, and create something that is good enough to show your skills, but that you also enjoy, because it can take a while to build.

This project can be anything, and can be programmed in any language.
