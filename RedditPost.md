Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster.

This is going to be a long post, so here's a TL;DR: I want to create a free online school for people to learn programming.

First off, let me apologize for my broken English, as it's not my main language.

Quick introduction: I've been studying programmation in a private French school that helps you learn with a project-based learning method.

My goal is to make this method popular online, by creating exercises and projects that help you (emphasis on help) become a developer.

The school isn't exactly meant to teach you, as it won't be made of actual classes, or tutorials. It's rather a way to help you learn on your own, by having exercises, and quick videos about the exercise, but you'll have to learn on your own to be able to complete it.

The first programming language learned would be C.

**Here's how the timeline would look like:**

You'd start with a sort of boot camp, then go on to work on small projects, then bigger group projects, and end up with a "Portfolio Project".

It will also be working on a "come whenever you want" basis. Exercises may be noted as "Day4", "Day5", but you can do them whenever you feel like. You can complete the boot camp in a few days, weeks or even months, the important part is that you enjoy learning.

**What is planned:**

- C boot camp, solo projects, group projects
- Streamed code reviews
- Streamed project reviews (if you spent more time creating bonuses on a project, we want to see them!)
- Short videos introducing the boot camp / project subjects

Everything on the project will also be made open-source, and you will be free to contribute.

In order for people to communicate, create groups, ask questions, I set up a Discord that you can find here:

If you want any more information about the project, the timeline, the discord, you can check out this temporary Github: https://github.com/PhilippeDeSousa/School.
