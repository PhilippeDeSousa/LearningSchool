# Discord

The goal of the Discord server is to have an easy way of communicating your questions, concerns, suggestions, and everything else.

It is also a place to find people to work with.

Working in a group is an excellent way to get better at programming, but it also shows you how to work with others, which is a priceless skill to acquire.
